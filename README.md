# Is My Friend Sus?
We are all familiar with the COVID-19 pandemic and have had to quarantine for extended periods of time to avoid spreading the disease. Research has shown that COVID-19 spreads at social gatherings, and spreads faster when people are in close proximity without protection.

Many of us have been playing Among Us during quarantine, where we guess which of our friends are imposters based on suspicious behavior. Many of us are also spending more time on social media, and finding ways to entertain ourselves with online quizzes such as the infamous Rice Purity Test. The Rice Purity Test asks several questions about risky behaviors and is designed “for students to track the maturation of their experiences throughout college.” As college students ourselves, we observe that students often become involved in risky behaviors through friend groups or parties, much like how COVID-19 spreads.

In the Among Us game, impostors sabotage the ship and kill teammates who are working together to maintain the ship. We’ve analogized imposter behavior as toxic online behavior in which their actions create conflict and spread chaos.
